# Virtual OS X on Macintosh

OS X on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is nothing but all kinds of troubles.  Even though OS X guests are now supported in the lastest VirtualBox, it still has several issues.  After investigated the boot process of OS X, I finally made OS X Lion and later working in VirtualBox.

---

## Requirement

1. Install OS X.app purchased in Mac App Store
2. [iESD](https://github.com/ntkme/iesd)

---

## VirtualBox Settings

- Operating System Version: Mac OS X (64 bit)
- Base Memory: 2048 MB (larger is better)
- **Enable EFI**

In the lastest VirtualBox, all the default settings work well.

> Some people encountered black screen upon booting the virtual machine.  They reported that changing the default chipset ICH9 to PIIX3 fixes this issue.

---

## Prepare Install Disk

``` sh
gem install iesd
```

> iESD requires ruby-1.9.2 or later.

#### El Capitan

Apple finally upgraded the MBR based `BaseSystem.dmg` in favor of GPT, which is not yet fully supported by VirtualBox EFI.  However, it is possible to upgrade from existing Yosemite installation.

#### Yosemite & Mavericks

The new `InstallESD.dmg` is not bootable.  Therefore, we need to create a bootable install disk with `BaseSystem.dmg`.

``` sh
iesd -i /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app -o Yosemite.dmg -t BaseSystem
```

All Macs using Intel Haswell CPU (Macs after 2013) need to fake their CPU as Ivy Bridge in order to boot the virtual machine.  Thank [@danmccombs](https://twitter.com/danmccombs/status/462241772521787392) for this tip.

``` sh
VBoxManage modifyvm <vmname> --cpuidset 00000001 000306a9 00020800 80000201 178bfbff
```

On Mac Pro Early 2009 and other Macs that have ECC memory, `AppleTyMCEDriver.kext` will cause a kernel panic during the boot.  Thus we need to remove it.

``` sh
iesd -i /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app -o Yosemite.dmg -t BaseSystem --uninstall-extension AppleTyMCEDriver.kext
```

#### Mountain Lion & Lion

The lastest VirtualBox does not require modifying `InstallESD.dmg` any more.

However, if your virtual machine was freezed during the boot process due to `AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext`, you need to install `NullCPUPowerManagement.kext`.

``` sh
iesd -i /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mountain\ Lion.app -o Mountain\ Lion.dmg --install-extension NullCPUPowerManagement.kext
```

## Install

The install process is same as normal OS X install on Mac.

---

## Done
