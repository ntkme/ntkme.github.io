# Introducing iESD

I created the shell script `InstallESD.dmg.tool` when I was trying to install [OS X on OS X]({% post_url 2012-09-07-os-x-on-os-x %}).  However, every time Apple releases a major version of OS X, Apple changes the structure of `InstallESD.dmg`.  As a result, the complexity of the script keeps increasing and the script is already over 350 lines.  Now, it's time to stop the crappy shell scripting.

Here comes the new [iESD](https://rubygems.org/gems/iesd).  Written entirely in Ruby.
