From [Darling Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/12/05/react-native-accessibility): 

> Wrong-headed developers want to use [   ] like [   ] because they think it’ll save them time and resources, but if they want to do it right — and good [   ] is most certainly part of doing it right — they’re making things harder on themselves. What they should admit openly is that they don’t care about doing it right, and in many cases are trying to cover up for the fact that they don’t know how to do it right.

Lovely wisdom right there.
